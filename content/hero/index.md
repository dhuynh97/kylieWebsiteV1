I'm an undergrad at [San Diego State University](https://www.sdsu.edu/) studying Communications. Whether working on academic, extracurricular or professional projects, I apply proven interpersonal, leadership, and teamwork skills. I have experience in customer service and customer satisfaction. I thrive in team settings and enjoy collaboration as well as self-reliance. I have worked on projects with the Communications team at Microsoft, which have introduced me to a corporate and professional environment. My areas of interest include Social Media, Public Relations and Digital Media Marketing.
