- As an intern at Microsoft, I helped assist the creation of content, graphics and multimedia needs in support of Microsoft Global Security. 
- I worked to develop storyboards along with creating and providing presentations to the Microsoft Communications team. Under guidance by my supervisor, I created content and updated the internal (employees only) and external (public view) Microsoft Global Security websites. 
- I audited the “security” photo library including officer photos, GSOC, GSAM, employee scanning badges, etc. - I served as a representative for Global Security and reached out to other departments of Microsoft to research and facilitate assigned projects. In this role, I developed knowledge in professionalism and learned how a corporate environment operates. This internship has aided my development with public presentation skills, enhanced skills in time management, organization, punctuality and overall performance. 
- I also gained invaluable insight in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Outlook/Calendar and other Microsoft applications.
- Worked closely with UI / UX designers and management team to develop, document, and manage the conference’s marketing website
