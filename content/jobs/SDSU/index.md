- As a Student Assistant, I work directly under the Development Coordinator and the Director of Development for the college of Professional Studies and Fine Arts. I assist with meetings, put together portfolio programs, and work closely with donor relations and scholarships.
I am responsible for formatting and sending donor solicitations for PSFA scholarships and programs. I set up and organize meetings between donors, committee members and SDSU staff. I utilize my skills in Microsoft Word and Excel almost daily.
I also design and create newsletters for each designated school under PSFA. For example: The School of Communication.
